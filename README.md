Flask Rec (recreation) League is an open sourced web application built with Flask for keeping track of recreation league games and statistics. It is customizable to support a wide variety recreation leagues such as competitive sports, gaming, and leisure activities. The application features player game submissions, admin control settings, team standings, custom player statistics, and more.

The web app is built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) for the web server. The database is built using [SQLAlchmey](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org). Forms are handled by [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io). Inspiration for this application is from Correy Schafer and his [Flask blog Youtube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH&si=zOMfxCs5rzkOL4g9).
