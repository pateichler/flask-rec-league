Developer
=========

Rec League is open sourced project. The following is documentation for developers to install and run their own instances. Also, see documentation on source code to contribute to this project.

The web app is built with `Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com>`_ for the web server. The database is built using `SQLAlchmey <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org>`_. Forms are handled by `WTForms <https://wtforms.readthedocs.io>`_. Inspiration is from Correy Schafer and his `Flask blog Youtube series <https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH&si=zOMfxCs5rzkOL4g9>`_.
